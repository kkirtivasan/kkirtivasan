# <u> Twitter Sentiment Analysis </u>

### Introduction
Tweets combined with a sentiment score can give you a gauge of your Tweets in a quantitative way. Twitter sentiment analysis allows you to keep track of what's being said about your product/service/brand on social media, and can help you detect angry customers or negative mentions before they escalate.

Twitter allows businesses to engage personally with consumers. However, thereâ€™s so much data on Twitter that it can be hard for brands to prioritize which tweets or mentions to respond to first.
That's why sentiment analysis has become a key instrument in social media marketing strategies.

Sentiment analysis is a tool that automatically monitors emotions in conversations on social media platforms.
