# <u> Superstore Data Visualization using R </u>

### Introduction

With growing demands and cut-throat competitions in the market, a Superstore Giant is seeking our knowledge in understanding what works best for them. They would like to understand which products, regions, categories and customer segments they should target or avoid. 
The dataset contains information about transactions, products, customers, and sales in a fictional or real-world superstore. It is often used for data analysis, business intelligence, and machine learning purposes.

With the dataset selected, the main task is to use this data to try and isolate and identify which regions, products, and sales times are the key drivers of the companysâ€™ financial success so that a hypothetical management team can make informed strategic decisions about which areas to improve upon. 
Given that goal, we start by exploring the data itself and cleaning it as necessary. Following this, we want to get a macro view of which regions were performing the best and then drill down into the times and products that are driving the sales success of those regions.
